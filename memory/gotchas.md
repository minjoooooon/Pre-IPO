# Mistakes Log

After any correction from the human, log the pattern here. Review at
session start before starting new work. The goal is to drive the error
rate toward zero.

Format:
- **Date** — *mistake* → **rule**

---

<!--
Examples:

- **2026-04-15** — Assumed `USER_ID` env var was set; silently fell back
  to empty string. → **Rule**: No silent fallbacks on env vars. Hard-fail
  at startup if required vars are missing.

- **2026-04-18** — Renamed `getUserPrefs` via grep; missed a dynamic
  import in `src/lib/legacy.ts`. → **Rule**: On every rename, search
  separately for static calls, type references, string literals, dynamic
  imports, re-exports, test mocks.
